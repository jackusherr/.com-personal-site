### Marketing Team at Allen Control Systems (ACS)

I was the first hire for the marketing team in June 2024, and now we have a full six person team.

ACS is a defense technology startup. We've developed a robot (Bullfrog) that uses a machine gun to shoot drones out of the sky. It's an ingenious combo of electrical engineering, robotics, computer vision, and mechanical engineering.

Here's a video. It is an awesome product.

### Podcast Producing

The second part of my job at ACS is to produce a podcast called [The Drone Ultimatum.](https://www.youtube.com/@thedroneultimatum) 

What initially started out as a hobby project of ACS's President (my ultimate boss) has turned into a full-blown voice in the industry. We launched in September 2024 and have published 61 episodes to date. Tens of thousands of downloads. We record every episode face-to-face, in person.

I'm in charge of everything except the hosting. I book the guests, organize logistics, prep the topics & questions, hire and manage the editor, set up and maintain the AV equipment, sit in the room and manage the recording process (while also speaking up occasionally during the episode), and a few other miscellaneous things. 

It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.

### Reading & Writing

I'm knee deep in the first volume of Robert Caro's Lyndon Johnson biography. It's masterfully written and full of interesting political history.

I'm also trying to get more into the classics. I just read *The Picture of Dorian Gray* and have a good stack on my nightstand to get to (books like *Pride and Prejudice,* *The Count of Monte Cristo,* *East of Eden,* etc.)

I'm trying to write blog posts here whenever I can too. A good practice to clarify my thoughts and keep a record of things.

### Family

My other full-time job is being a husband and a dad. Best jobs in the world. Men, I highly recommend it.
