## What I'm Doing Now

#### I. Marketing Team at Allen Control Systems (ACS)

I was the first hire for the marketing team in June 2024, and now we have a full six person team.

ACS is a defense technology startup. We've developed a robot (Bullfrog) that uses a machine gun to shoot drones out of the sky. It's an ingenious combo of electrical engineering, robotics, computer vision, and mechanical engineering.

[Here's a video](https://youtube.com/shorts/2DJru3rbVR0?si=rVvYvemUdUtORCmm). It is an awesome product.

#### II. Podcast Producing

The second part of my job at ACS is to produce a podcast called [The Drone Ultimatum.](https://www.youtube.com/@thedroneultimatum) 

What initially started out as a hobby project of our company President (my ultimate boss) has turned into a full-blown voice in the industry. We launched in September 2024 and have published 61 episodes to date. Tens of thousands of downloads. We record every episode face-to-face, in person.

I'm in charge of everything except the hosting. I book the guests, organize logistics, prep the topics & questions, hire and manage the editor, set up and maintain the AV equipment, sit in the room and manage the recording process (while also speaking up occasionally during the episode), and a few other miscellaneous things. 

It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.

#### III. Reading

I'm knee deep in the first volume of Robert Caro's Lyndon Johnson biography. It's masterfully written and full of interesting political history.

I'm getting more into the classics. I just read *The Picture of Dorian Gray* and have a good stack on my nightstand to get to: *Pride and Prejudice,* *The Count of Monte Cristo,* *East of Eden,* etc.

#### IV. Family

My other full-time job is being a husband and a dad. Best jobs in the world. Men, I highly recommend it.

## About Me

I grew up in northwestern Wisconsin. I went to Notre Dame for college and moved to the Washington D.C. area to get into politics, which I did for just one year before finding ACS.

I'm writing on my blog whenever I can. It's a new personal project. Links to that and other places to find me below:
