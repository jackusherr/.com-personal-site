## What I'm Doing Now

#### I. Marketing Team at Allen Control Systems (ACS)


ACS is a defense technology startup. We've developed a robotic weapon system that uses a machine gun to shoot drones out of the sky. It's an ingenious combo of computer vision + EE + MechE.

[Here's a video](https://youtube.com/shorts/2DJru3rbVR0?si=rVvYvemUdUtORCmm). I don't think most people really believe or understand me when I tell them what our company does.

I was the first marketing hire in June 2024. We now have a full team of seven people. 

If helping build this sounds awesome, [we are hiring](https://www.allencontrolsystems.com/company#jobs) across business ops, engineering, and manufacturing in Austin, TX.

#### II. Podcast Producing

The second part of my job at ACS is to produce our podcast, [The Drone Ultimatum.](https://www.youtube.com/@thedroneultimatum) 

What began as a hobby project of our company President has turned into a full-blown voice in the industry. We launched in September 2024 and have published over 60 episodes to date. Tens of thousands of downloads. We record every episode in person.

I'm in charge of everything except the hosting. I book the guests, organize logistics, prep the topics & questions, hire and manage the editor, set up and maintain the AV equipment, sit in the room and manage the recording process, and the other miscellaneous things to make the podcast happen every week. 

It's a lot of work and a ton of fun.

#### III. Family

My other full-time job is being a husband and a dad. Best jobs in the world. Men, I highly recommend it.

## About Me

I grew up in northwestern Wisconsin. I went to Notre Dame for college and moved to the Washington D.C. area to get into politics, which I did for just one year before finding ACS.
