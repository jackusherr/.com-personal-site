A small skill to improve your social life and career: Master the "graceful exit." 

You don't have to make things up or be awkward about exiting a situation. Just be clear, kind, and graceful.

I think it's only 10% knowledge and 90% confidence. The grace is achieved when you pick the right moment to exit, and put the full force of your confidence into executing it.
