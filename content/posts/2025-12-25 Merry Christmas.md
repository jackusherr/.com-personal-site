1. [isitchristmas.com](https://isitchristmas.com/). A friend showed me this site in high school. It's so pointless, yet I've never forgotten it. Today is the only day of the year where it says something different. The power of a great domain name!
   
2. Now that I'm a dad, I think a lot more about Santa. I'm not surprised that many kids believe in Santa long past the age where you'd think they would "figure it out." It's because they want to believe it's true—to feel like there really is magic in the world. That belief and optimism is what I wish more adults would take away from those kids.

3. If you want a very quiet, almost off-putting air travel experience, fly on Christmas Eve. My small plane was only about half full and the airports on either end were ghost towns.
