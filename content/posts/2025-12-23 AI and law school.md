One of the effects of widespread AI adoption should be (finally?) proving that law school isn't a good haven for directionless people or people who can't find a job.

If AI really is coming for all the lawyers, there's no way law school in its current form survives it.

 *Inspired by [this article](https://spectator.com/article/ai-will-kill-all-the-lawyers/) about an old British lawyer seeing AI write a perfect brief in about 10 seconds.*
