  <h3 id="marketing-team-at-allen-control-systems-acs">Marketing Team at Allen Control Systems (ACS)</h3>
<p>I was the first hire for the marketing team in June 2024, and now we have a full six person team.</p>
<p>ACS is a defense technology startup. We&rsquo;ve developed a robot (Bullfrog) that uses a machine gun to shoot drones out of the sky. It&rsquo;s an ingenious combo of electrical engineering, robotics, computer vision, and mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video. It is an awesome product.</p>
<h3 id="podcast-producing">Podcast Producing</h3>
<p>The second part of my job at ACS is to produce a podcast called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thedroneultimatum">The Drone Ultimatum.</a></p>
<p>What initially started out as a hobby project of ACS&rsquo;s President (my ultimate boss) has turned into a full-blown voice in the industry. We launched in September 2024 and have published 61 episodes to date. Tens of thousands of downloads. We record every episode face-to-face, in person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in charge of everything except the hosting. I book the guests, organize logistics, prep the topics &amp; questions, hire and manage the editor, set up and maintain the AV equipment, sit in the room and manage the recording process (while also speaking up occasionally during the episode), and a few other miscellaneous things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of work, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<h3 id="reading--writing">Reading &amp; Writing</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m knee deep in the first volume of Robert Caro&rsquo;s Lyndon Johnson biography. It&rsquo;s masterfully written and full of interesting political history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to get more into the classics. I just read <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> and have a good stack on my nightstand to get to (books like <em>Pride and Prejudice,</em> <em>The Count of Monte Cristo,</em> <em>East of Eden,</em> etc.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to write blog posts here whenever I can too. A good practice to clarify my thoughts and keep a record of things.</p>
<h3 id="family">Family</h3>
<p>My other full-time job is being a husband and a dad. Best jobs in the world. Men, I highly recommend it.</p>
