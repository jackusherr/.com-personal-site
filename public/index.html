        <h2><a href="/posts/2025-12-25-merry-christmas/">Merry Christmas!</a></h2>
        <ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://isitchristmas.com/">isitchristmas.com</a>. A friend showed me this site in high school. It&rsquo;s so pointless, yet I&rsquo;ve never forgotten it. Today is the only day of the year where it says something different. The power of a great domain name!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m a dad, I think a lot more about Santa. I&rsquo;m not surprised that many kids believe in Santa long past the age where you&rsquo;d think they would &ldquo;figure it out.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s because they want to believe it&rsquo;s true—to feel like there really is magic in the world. That belief and optimism is what I wish more adults would take away from those kids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want a very quiet, almost off-putting air travel experience, fly on Christmas Eve. My small plane was only about half full and the airports on either end were ghost towns.</p>

        <h2><a href="/posts/2025-12-24-the-graceful-exit/">The Graceful Exit</a></h2>
        <p>A small skill to improve your social life and career: Master the &ldquo;graceful exit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to make things up or be awkward about exiting a situation. Just be clear, kind, and graceful.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only 10% knowledge and 90% confidence. The grace is achieved when you pick the right moment to exit, and put the full force of your confidence into executing it.</p>

        <h2><a href="/posts/2025-12-23-ai-and-law-school/">AI and Law School</a></h2>
        <p>One of the effects of widespread AI adoption should be (finally?) proving that law school isn&rsquo;t a good haven for directionless people or people who can&rsquo;t find a job.</p>
<p>If AI really is coming for all the lawyers, there&rsquo;s no way law school in its current form survives it.</p>
<p><em>Inspired by <a href="https://spectator.com/article/ai-will-kill-all-the-lawyers/">this article</a> about an old British lawyer seeing AI write a perfect brief in about 10 seconds.</em></p>
