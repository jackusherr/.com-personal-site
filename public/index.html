    <h2 id="what-im-doing-now">What I&rsquo;m Doing Now</h2>
<h4 id="i-marketing-team-at-allen-control-systems-acs">I. Marketing Team at Allen Control Systems (ACS)</h4>
<p>I was the first hire for the marketing team in June 2024, and now we have a full six person team.</p>
<p>ACS is a defense technology startup. We&rsquo;ve developed a robot (Bullfrog) that uses a machine gun to shoot drones out of the sky. It&rsquo;s an ingenious combo of electrical engineering, robotics, computer vision, and mechanical engineering.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/allencontrol/status/2013369081584300040?s=20">Here&rsquo;s a video</a>. It is an awesome product.</p>
<h4 id="ii-podcast-producing">II. Podcast Producing</h4>
<p>The second part of my job at ACS is to produce a podcast called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thedroneultimatum">The Drone Ultimatum.</a></p>
<p>What initially started out as a hobby project of our company President (my ultimate boss) has turned into a full-blown voice in the industry. We launched in September 2024 and have published 61 episodes to date. Tens of thousands of downloads. We record every episode face-to-face, in person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in charge of everything except the hosting. I book the guests, organize logistics, prep the topics &amp; questions, hire and manage the editor, set up and maintain the AV equipment, sit in the room and manage the recording process (while also speaking up occasionally during the episode), and a few other miscellaneous things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of work, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<h4 id="iii-reading">III. Reading</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m knee deep in the first volume of Robert Caro&rsquo;s Lyndon Johnson biography. It&rsquo;s masterfully written and full of interesting political history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting more into the classics. I just read <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> and have a good stack on my nightstand to get to: <em>Pride and Prejudice,</em> <em>The Count of Monte Cristo,</em> <em>East of Eden,</em> etc.</p>
<h4 id="iv-family">IV. Family</h4>
<p>My other full-time job is being a husband and a dad. Best jobs in the world. Men, I highly recommend it.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I grew up in northwestern Wisconsin. I went to Notre Dame for college and moved to the Washington D.C. area to get into politics, which I did for just one year before finding ACS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing on my blog whenever I can. It&rsquo;s a new personal project. Links to that and other places to find me below:</p>
